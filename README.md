# React Boilerplate

### TODO
- [ ] [Asynchronously Load webpack Bundles through Code-splitting and React Suspense](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-asynchronously-load-webpack-bundles-through-code-splitting-and-react-suspense)

  
- [X] [Run a Simple Test with Jest in a React App](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-run-a-simple-test-with-jest-in-a-react-app)
  - a lot of warnings and a depricated package when installing Jest. Jest seems to be the prefered tool to test React but let's see about that. 

- [X] [Set Up Tests that Render a React Component with Jest and Babel](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-set-up-tests-that-render-a-react-component-with-jest-and-babel)
  - this is very much outdated and you have to read the comments very carefully and a lot of the imports 
  - are not required at all

- [ ] [Set up Testing Globals in an Application with Jest](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-set-up-testing-globals-in-an-application-with-jest)
  - skipped this because I don't use globals for now

- [ ] [Configure Prettier to Automatically Format Code](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-configure-prettier-to-automatically-format-code)
  - skipped and I will look at this later

- [X] [Run Linting, Tests and Prettier in git Hooks with Husky](https://egghead.io/lessons/git-run-linting-tests-and-prettier-in-git-hooks-with-husky)
  - use husky 2.7.0 - the latest version breaks because of incompatible with git version 2.11.0

- [X] [Create an Error Boundary for a React App](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-create-an-error-boundary-for-a-react-app)
  - 

- [X] [Define Prop Types for a React Class Component](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-define-prop-types-for-a-react-class-component)
  - as this stage I haven't followed the step for lint so thsi is done withoout linting
