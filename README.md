# React Boilerplate

### TODO
- [ ] [Asynchronously Load webpack Bundles through Code-splitting and React Suspense](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-asynchronously-load-webpack-bundles-through-code-splitting-and-react-suspense)

  
- [X] [Run a Simple Test with Jest in a React App](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-run-a-simple-test-with-jest-in-a-react-app)
  - a lot of warnings and a depricated package when installing Jest. Jest seems to be the prefered tool to test React but let's see about that. 

- [X] [Set Up Tests that Render a React Component with Jest and Babel](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-set-up-tests-that-render-a-react-component-with-jest-and-babel)
  - this is very much outdated and you have to read the comments very carefully and a lot of the imports 
  - are not required at all

- [ ] [Set up Testing Globals in an Application with Jest](https://egghead.io/lessons/jest-set-up-testing-globals-in-an-application-with-jest)
  - skipped this because I don't use globals for now

- [ ][Configure Prettier to Automatically Format Code](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-configure-prettier-to-automatically-format-code)
  - skipped and I will look at this later
